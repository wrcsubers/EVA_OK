  * In Vacuum: Your ship must have the Throttle at 0%.
  * All other times the doors are automatically locked.
* Bypass mode:
  * Map-able bypass button.
  * Access EVA OK! Settings while in the Space Center view.
    * Map any keyboard button (unmodified only, ie Shift+H WON'T work).
    * Setting is saved externally and loads automatically across sessions/flights.
    * Hold down your mapped button on your keyboard to EVA at anytime.
* Fixed issue with naming and cross-platform compatibility (removed '!' from name).
